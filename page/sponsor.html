			<h1>Hay there!</h1>
			<p>Thank you for checking out my project. My name's <a href="https://github.com/sponsors/g105b/" target="_blank">Greg</a>, and I like to build stuff online.</p>
			<p>This project was started due to frustration with existing tools, but also as a fun side project to sharpen my tools.</p>
			<p>I plan to keep this tool under development, but <strong>always free to use</strong> - and I've set up this humble page to try and attract sponsorship towards ongoing development.</p>
			<p>Your support helps api.horse gallop ahead with future development, but keeps the reins tight with quality and security.</p>

			<h1>Saddle up</h1>
			<p>If you'd like to see a specific feature, let me know! Open a <a href="https://github.com/g105b/api.horse/issues/" target="_blank">new issue</a> on GitHub and we can start a conversation, or open a <a href="https://github.com/g105b/api.horse/pulls/" target="_blank">pull request</a> if you'd like to contribute something yourself.</p>
			<h1>How to sponsor?</h1>
			<p>Let's not hoof around any longer - you can <a href="https://github.com/sponsors/g105b/" target="_blank">sponsor the developer on GitHub</a> as much or as little as you'd like. Any help will be greatly appreciated!</p>
